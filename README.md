# **Simple Garmin Watchface**

### **Description**
This is my first attempt at building a Garmin Watchface using Monkey C.
My main reason for building this project is to use this watchface on my Garmin Forerunner 165 Music (and I am currently using this watchface). Thus, it has only been tested on the Forerunner 165 Music model.

### **Data Fields**
- *Notifications Indicator*
- *Phone Connection Indicator (Bluetooth)*
- *Current Date*
- *Battery*
- *Calories*
- *Heart Rate*
- *Weekly Running Distance (in miles)*

### **Planned Features**
This watchface is still a work in progress. I plan on building settings with a menu that will allow the user to customize the appearance and possibily the data fields for the watchface on their device.

### **Alternative Color Scheme**
For now, an alternative color scheme is available on the alt branch. This is just until the on-device settings are ironed out.
